    <p>
      I'm not sure if I have favorite songs for coding, I can get easily
      distracted by music, I tend to enjoy it so much. I do like classic rock
      alot. I like female Rock artists as well. I use music to escape.

        <h3>&#9788 Lyrics &#9788</h3>

        <p>Hey lady, you got the love I need <br>
            Maybe more than enough <br>
            Oh darling, darling, darling <br>
            Walk a while with me <br>
            Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much <br>
            <br>
            Many have I loved, and many times been bitten <br>
            Many times I've gazed along the open road <br>
            <br>
            Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened <br>
            Many times I've wondered how much there is to know <br>
            <br>
            Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings <br>
            I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold<br>
            <br>
            Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing<br>
            Many, many men can't see the open road<br>
            <br>
            Many is a word that only leaves you guessing<br>
            Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)<br>
            I really ought to know<br>
            Oh<br>
            You know I should, you know I should, you know I should,<br> you know I should</p>
